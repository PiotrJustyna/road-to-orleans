# road to orleans

This repository illustrates the road to orleans in production. From most basic, to more advanced techniques. The code is written using .NET 5 and was tested on MacOS (Catalina 10.15.7) and, wherever docker is supported, Linux (Alpine 3.12).

## build & run

* IDE: build + run (first the cluster, then the client)
* docker (where supported): `run.sh`

## monitoring

Silo dashboards are available by default on `localhost:8080` unless configured otherwise in the code/`dockerfile`/`run.sh`.
